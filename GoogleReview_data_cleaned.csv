Alison Stevens	2	I came here for breakfast based on other reviews and was disappointed. Ordered poached eggs, bacon and toast. The eggs were the half-cooked type and the toast - although tasty - was fruit loaf so didnâ€™t suit the savoury nature of the breakfast.	Fish and Chips by Bareeseta	Ipoh

Chris C.H	3	The long black was okay, but I feel that it could use some improvement. Less water and more of the presence of the coffee would help.  Didn't try the food as I had dim sum prior to getting my caffeine fix before heading out to Gua Tempurung.	Fish and Chips by Bareeseta	Ipoh

Loopy	4	Good atmosphere and quiet on weekdays. The staff is polite and patience. Reason that doesn't get 5 stars is because the air conditioning is not cold enough, they are cooking in the same area even they have exhaust fan for thier kitchen, somehow doesn't bring any value to the oldies environment. Would definitely visit again.	Burps & Giggles	Ipoh
Amy Rae	3	Average cafe, with a rustic feel. They're trying a bit too hard to make the menu look unique that you end up questioning half the items of the menu, also half the terms are french which does not fit with the theme. For example a burger	Burps & Giggles	Ipoh

Khairul Anuar Shaharudin	4	It has its own attraction being in a run down looking shophouse to make it soooooo hipstur but it has good cakes and coffee.

Ciaara T. Paen	5	Hot, fresh and queue was long. Good thing the staff came to update us 30 minutes wait so we can decide to wait or go off.

EK T	3	Was introduced to it by friends,  bot a chicken to try. Didnt think very much of it, nothing special. While the chicken was nice and tender, the herbal taste was mild, and not very tasty or even salty. I wonder what is the rage over it. They could probably enhanced it and sell some special chili or sweet sauce to go with it.	Ayam Garam Aun Kheng Lim (Main Branch)	Ipoh
Julie â€œJuliePâ€ Pan	4	The amount of chickens wrapped in paper bags easily came to a hundred on the countertop, prepped for takeaway. Wow. Very efficient.There is no menu.

Pat Beck	5	The salt chicken for 19 MYR is worth every cent. The organic, free-range chicken is succulent and incredibly juicy. The juices trapped by the paper it is cooked in can be salty on their own however. This is a truly delicious preparation	Ayam Garam Aun Kheng Lim (Main Branch)	Ipoh

Low Poh Yi	1	I visited this shop few times few years ago. Everything taste different. Carbonara is very salty. The pizza crust is burnt and taste bitter. They gave me paper plates and bottled water without glass. I do not enjoy anything with paper	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh

Joanne	5	Excellent choice of music that suited the theme of the restaurant and food to table was prompted. I'm the type who usually skip the crest of the pizza but the crest was amazing! Highly recommend their cheese pizza because their cheese holds a rich taste to it.	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh

Meagan Chan	5	Delicious authentic wood fired pizzas and nice environment to have some pizzas and soft drinks. We has the truffle oil and bacon & egg pizza. Taste really good. Carbonara was OK cuz I think it has too much garlic and sauce not sufficient. Overall, it's a restaurant I'll visit again	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh

Chun Kheong Chong	4	Had a great time here with my fiancee. Good pizza but too big for 2 person. Great ambience and nice Christmas music. I ordered Bacon & Egg. However, the egg fillings made the pizza crust quite soft and wet when it was left for quite some time.	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
Shem Daniel	4	Only place in Ipoh that I know that serves Bacon Pizza, which is a must have if you're eating here. Soft drinks could be cheaper (maybe a bottomless option if it's feasible?).	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh

Sukhdav Singh	5	My first time ever trying out bacon pizzas, and I was not dissapointed. The pizza portion is huge and filling, but it's a bit on the pricier side. So get ready to spend. The waiters and waitresses are so energetic, it makes you feel good, just to be in this food joint. Would definitely return for more.	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
leon cornelious	5	Been a patron of them throughout my student days. The best non-halal pizza place in Ipoh. As of November 2021 dine in is not available yet but nevertheless this place is worth it. Reasonable pizzas at big portions and is very VERY delicious ðŸ˜‹	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
Madhav Manoj Karayil Thekkoott	3	It's pretty decent American pizza. However it was dissaponting in some aspects. Firstly, there wasn't enough cheese and sauce around the edges. Making it dry and flavourless around the edges. And additional sauce was about 4rm so thats	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
Naresh Kandasamy	5	Their pizza is best to be eaten while still hot. Can choose two different kind of pizza and combine into one. Staff is very friendly. Pizza can be eaten by 3 to 4 pax and lots of toppings are added onto the pizza (chicken comes in chunky size). Better than pizza hut or dominos( my personal opinion) and the best part they do serve beer	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
Yoke Hwa Lai	5	The cheesiness of the pizza is just right. Combined with the crispiness of the crust, you will get food coma! The white truffle oil pizza is a must try!	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh

Lester Gan	2	Just a review of their new pizza, the BIC or something like that. Bacon pizza with sausages, absolutely horrible. Bacon was chewy and wasn't cut into small pieces, ended up not cooked well in the oven creating a pool of liquid in the centre of the pizza. Not a great experience. Didn't even finish it.	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh

Amy Loke	5	A must-try when you stop by Ipoh. Tricky thing is they are only open for dinner. I love their 3 Cheese pizza and the bacon and eggs pizza. Super good. The pizza dough is perfect. The tiramisu is also a must order, even if you're stuffed and	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh

Vinny Randhawa	5	The best pizzeria so far, i am a regular customer and have been coming to this restaurant since it was a single restaurant to a double restaurant and now a single restaurant back.

Jasmine Ms	3	Food is tasty, especially their pizza. Unfortunately we can't take the loud music, difficult to have a proper conversation with the people you are with. Plus we find the serving of the pizza on a high tin can not acceptable, almost eye	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh

Edward Chong	5	Good Peruvian Pasta , great Bacon and egg pizza. Worth a visit.	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
Toh Jing Wei	5	One of the best places to have an American styled pizza in Perak. If you're curious, American style pizzas usually have thinner crust and have many different types of toppings. They use a wood fire oven which is very traditional and will	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
Cassandra Monteiro	5	My ultimate go to place for pizza when Iâ€™m in Ipoh. The pizzas are so uniquely made with unique flavours. Absolutely love the bacon and eggs and sweet & salty.

Amy Wong	5	Starting going to Michelangelo's Pizza back after they first came on the scene about 12 years ago.  Saw them grow from a small one shop store to a large two shop store.  Then we moved to Penang. Been our favorite place time and time again	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
Yap Kah Han	4	Nice pizza here... Delicious hog bacon... But price on higher side...	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
Susan Tan	5	My boyfriend & I  drive up from Penang at least twice a month just to eat here.  Great unbeatable service with the friendliest and coolest staff and pizzas cooked in a real wood fire oven.  Usually a wait to get inside so better to come	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
Samantha Tiang	5	Great place with lovely food! Friendly staff and owner. The place had a lovely ambience to it, with the pizza oven clearly visible to customers. The bacon and egg pizza is to die for and I would also highly recommend Miki's Hawaiian for those who like a bit of spice. Prices are pretty reasonable too!	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh

Sanjit Singh	5	I've been here twice recently and the service has been great so far. They are quick and attentive. Even the head honcho aka the propietor I assume interacts with the customers. Food wise I love the pizza here and I think it's one of the	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
Hammond Lai	3	Pizza specialty restaurant. Tastes good. Service was good. 80s music ambience, but lighting was too bright for my liking at dinner. Drinks are way too expensive for the ambience. Beer was the only alcoholic drink available, and it costs 15 per can. Come here only if you crave to eat good pizza	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
Pauline Looi	5	We love the pizzas here, generous with ingredients and very tasty. We also like it that we are allowed to have half hog and half vegetarian and there are a few vegetarian varieties to choose from. We usually go before 7pm and generally it	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh

SeeYan Wong	4	Pizza is freshly baked and delicious but the portion is quite big for a couple of persons.	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
Kula Manter	5	I'm giving this place 5-stars, because it excels as what it is: a family-style American pizza place.	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
Chin Siang Ong	5	One of the best pizzas, probably not only in Ipoh but whole Malaysia! Taste so well that you not gonna eat Dominos or Pizza Hut for the rest of your life. Me and my friends love the blue cheese! One of the downside was not serving any water	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
Markus Olset	5	Came down with family from Kuala Lumpur on our way to Penang for the weekend. Stoped over in Ipoh for dinner because we have heard a lot about the pizzas here.  We have to say everything we heard is true.  They have the best pizzas we have	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh

Rex Smith	5	First time visit here with my friends. Ordered the most expensive pizza on the menu, a plate of pasta and two cans of A&W beers. Quite pricey but what bothers me the most is the saltiness of the food. It would be ideal if you could do	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
Andrew Oh	5	Excellent!... Pizza, Pasta, Salad and Brownie desert...	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
luvfeelin ä¹é£žç¿Ž (ä¹é£žç¿Ž)	5	By recommendation of local friend, my husband and I came here for a simple pizza dinner. When I saw there is many people queueing out there, I was afraid that we need to wait for a long time yet I am so hungry at that moment. We were told	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
T FM (TFM)	2	Pizza is not impressive. Lot of tomato sauce which made it rather sweet, as there were no other flavours/spices to complement the tomatoes.Bottom of pizza was good: crispy and not thick.	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
V Jun	5	My favourite pizza place in Ipoh. In this place the pizza is totally different from the chain pizza restaurant , so please do not expect that you will get thick dough pizza ðŸ•. Bacon and egg is my favourite still, btw you may order half half pizza. Noooooooooooo doubt that I can finish all by my own.	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
Derek Kho	5	Still the best pizza in the town! Crowded always during dinner and no reservation applied, so mostly have to wait outside till there's have a seat but the wait it's worth while! Traditional pizza baked method with American culture dine in atmosphere.	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
yue xin	5	You can smell the pizza once you enter the shop. It's totally different from Domino or Pizza Hut, freshly made and bake. Sometime you will need to queue at outside if it is full house at moment. The waiters served with a smile and polite to the customers.	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
Evon Wong	4	Price for pizza is average just enough for 3-4 person but side dishes and especially salad, does not really worth the price.Nice pizza and a suitable environment for friends and family. Loud and fantastic music played!	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
Keng Hao	5	It is a good place to dine at if youâ€™re a pizza lover like me, tons of choices for me and each time I go , I tried out different types of pizza , and none of it failed me so far. The environment is decent and so are the waiters, they served	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh

Ananth Arunasalam	5	Bestest pizzeria in Ipoh. No frills, classic, rustic and young outlook.I know they have lots of good reviews but it's time to talk about the music!In here, 80's retro music vies for supremacy over delicious, soulful, wood	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
Gurmeet Singh	5	I always make it a point to visit Michelangelo's Pizza everytime I am in Ipoh. Not only are the pizzas divine (especially the blue cheese pizza), the music and the service is excellent as well. The owner is also very welcoming and friendly. Overall, another 10/10 experience and I will definitely return when I am in Ipoh again	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
Aris Hasan	2	In terms of food, it taste delicious. In terms of service staff attitude and attention, need further improvement. (previous comments)	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
Dylan Low	5	Best homemade recipe pizza in Ipoh Town! The person who open this business is from America, which brings the feeling of a Chicago style Pizza from the environment in the restaurant, especially the music. There are many different choices of	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
GuoLng Ong	4	2/3 for food, interesting and unique taste. Depends on personal favorite (blue cheese ðŸ‘) . Just that the only thing can be improve is the crust. The middle is soft, but can't be prevented with such huge pizza. Anyway, recommended. 1/1 decorations & 1/2 services. ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘Œ	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
Si Wei Choong	5	Enjoy having cheesy, meaty,crunchy pizza here a lot. Nice dine in environment too. Staff n boss r so friendly . Worth to tryðŸ˜‰	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
NZ Yew	3	Ordered a half/half pizza with white truffle oil/bacon & eggs. Not sure if it is because of the bacon & eggs, the pizza bread is flooded and not crispy anymore especially in the center of pizza which I see it as a big flaw, but the pizza bread is high quality from the corner part. Overall a nice experience.	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
Jessica Lau	5	A very good place to enjoy pizza if you love Rock & Roll music. Varieties of toppings to choose from for the pizza. It's unique because the pizza is wood-fire made and also you can do a half-and-half which means you can choose 2 flavors on	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
Rob Greig	4	Good prices for portions. If youâ€™re looking for a quiet and relaxing dinner go elsewhere as itâ€™s very busy and very loud. I wasnâ€™t blown away by the flavour but wife and daughter were very happy with theirs.	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
Calvin Yeoh	5	It goes down to be possibly the best restaurant in the town! For its price, you are not able to get a pizza this good from other place! The pizza is just so good that i am running out of word to describe it, only you tongue can translate you into words after you try it for yourself!!	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
genie	5	Good and friendly customer services...very happening restaurant.	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
Ray Yeap	5	Nice pizza! Recommended to eat here!	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh

Jiann Wui Foo	2	Michelangelo's PizzeriaService:	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
Meng Poh Lee	3	The food is good. Just the background music is a bit noisy.	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
Rachel Soh	5	The pizza is AMAZING. Looks good, tastes good - worth the price. The workers are very friendly, always smiling and they seem very happy to serve you. The vibe of the place is cool, I love it.	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
Hades Demetrius	2	Went there on 18/9/2017. The food has proven to be satisfying, yet the service provided was disappointing, particularly the guy at the counter. He needs proper manners while dealing with customers.	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
Amelia Uhen	5	The best Pizza! Always love the food here. Never miss a meal whenever i am back in Ipoh! Had to step on the pedal just to get to the restaurant in time for orders before it closes.	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
William Chang	4	If you want to feel the authenticity of real American pizza, you can come here. This place is great for groups of people (preferably teenagers to young adults) cause it can get quite noisy due to loud music.	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
Ung Lee Lan	1	Decided to go there for some food when we heard about the good pizza. However, was put off by the bad PR when my daughter was told that outside drink was not allowed. Come on, it's only a girl, carrying her almost empty water bottle. Regardless of how good the food is, arrogance has no part in the service industry.	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
Andrew Lim	5	This is the best pizzaria in Ipoh! Non Halal though. The music here is loud and pumped up. On the other hand, it drowns out the conversation from the other tables. Brilliant idea, but if you do have a problem with your hearing, not too good	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
Wan Nin Lee	5	They provide amazing delivery service with delicious menu during this Movement Control Order (MCO) / Restriction Movement Order (RMO) period.. Their BBQ Pork Ribs and Brownies are definitely to be highlighted!! Recommending to those who crave for something special during this stay-at-home times..	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh

Fu Kai Yap	5	A rare find indeed in Malaysia. A very good pizza. Menu wise too much toppings choices. Personally I think when it comes to pizza less is definitely more. Try to offer some kick ass margherita pizza and I'll be sold.	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
ZZ Lai	5	One of the best, if not the best pizza place available in Ipoh. Given the price, they serve various gourmet pizzas that are worth every penny. However, customers should care to note that the boss of the establishments have certain	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
Lac Mac	4	Just had a great pizza but let down by the pathetic salad. Salad cost about rm15 and guess what you get? A bowl of lettuce with some dressing. Not even a tomato. Come on guys, at least make an effort add some tomato's, cucumber, sweetcorn	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
LT Wong	3	Pizza taste good. However price is expensive.  Music is loud,  just the way the restaurant boss like it.Small portion of pizza crust is burn and over cook.	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
Mark Twain	5	The tastiest pork pizza I've had in Malaysia. Of course like most outlets in Malaysia, overall quality and consistency suffers once business is good.	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
Iris Cheong	4	Great customer service and am happy the staff informed us that you can choose 2 flavours for the pizzas. Very good pizzas. Love the rootbeer float.	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh

Victor Lam	5	Simple great place for pizza!	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
Bobby N	5	As an American in malaysia I've had my fair share of pizza here. Easily the best pizza joint in Ipoh. Plus the environment and owner are super cool!	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
360 Navigate	4	A small pizzeria in an unassuming yet strategic location, Michaelangelo's Pizzeria is an Ipoh favourite but probably doesn't get highlighted much as a local specialty due to its Western nature. Being in a somewhat minority by serving pork,	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
kenny lee	5	I love it... Here pizza so delicious and ðŸ˜‹	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh

Jennyfer Ang	1	Unacceptable house rulesâ—ï¸â—ï¸Have to full guest reach only be served to sit. Not allowed for advanced	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
Kah Soon Ang	5	Pizza - I know I will go for Pizza Hut when I am in Ipoh, but knowing a Michelangelo's Pizzeria in Ipoh is quite a surprise to me, more so that it is operated by a Westerner. No long list of food greets you in Michelangelo's Pizzeria's	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
Tiffany Teo	5	The owner and the staff are running the place from the bottom of their heart. Bravo	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh

Shamsul Bin Jamaluddin	5	Great pizza made with a real fire oven. Good music but the ads can be jaring. Staff are incredibly perky, which can be a good or bad thing. Overall, two thumbs up.	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
Michael Min	5	Best Pizza in Town and maybe in all of Malaysia. Appetizers are a 4/5, their salad is 5/5, and pizza is 10 out of 5. Highly recommended	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
Chow Kah Fai	5	Pizza and other foods are very tasty	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
Joe Cage	1	Lousy pizzas.Too much hype by Ipohrians about  the blue cheese pizza.Not worth the prize for a substandard pizza.Toppings and cheese not sufficient instead they put a lot of cherry tomotoes.	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
Allan Morpheus	5	Celebrating our eldest sonâ€™s completion of UPSR exams! Generous helpings of meat and sausages and bursting with Mozzarella cheese, the kids just love Michaelangeloâ€™s pizza and wouldnâ€™t settle for any other pizza joints (the rest just pales	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
Wong Woei Luen	4	The place is a cool and authentic pizza place in Ipoh. Just that the day we went was packed and the staff was a little overwhelmed. The pizza will be perfect if they can baked it for another 5 mins.	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
Nathanael Kwek	3	Great place. For having a lively group dining. Food here is great.  But with the pub environment where the music are blasting I would say it's not suitable for those who like to dine peacefully and quietly	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
Tack Heng	3	Music and songs played in the restaurant are loud until you are barely can have a relaxing conversation with your friends or your family.  The waiters do not really addressing your request to lower music volume as if music and songs were played for amusement of themselves instead of customers.	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
Elly K	4	Nice food and great portion too.But Friday their theme is Rock'n Roll, so the music might be abit loud and not suitable for friends gathering or long chat.	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
Angela Marie	4	Great food and great atmosphere. Gets noisy with all the crowd. We went with 2 small kids and the staff accomodated us very well. Busy restaurant so best to go for an early dinner :)	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
noreen kong	1	So eager to come back after the first try. But end up with a great disappointment. Ordered two pizza. The second pizza is over cook and was burned at surface and bottom. It tasted bitter, spoiled the taste. Pasta was a failure. Even my son refuse to eat. guess the chef put too much flour and made the dish so sticky.	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
Jeffrey Tham	5	Great pizzas, imaginative menus. Lively atmosphere, but greats crowded fast. Definitely some of the best and more authentic pizzas in the country.	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
Alex Voo	5	The pizza's portion are big and full in its filling. The enviroment is somewhat cozy but it sets to mood to make the pizzeria a happy place to eat.	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
William Fong	4	Best hand made classic american style stove pizza. Only handmade pizza with serving of pork in ipoh. None halal, best tasting pizza in ipoh. Crowded at times, does not bother to serve bitchy customer that hog table without ordering. So there is always seats for those ready to dine. (y)	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
Song	3	Food is definitely the best pizza available in ipoh. But with the service is so so. Maybe the male staffs could try to put on more smiles on their faces would make the whole experience more enjoyable.	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh

Yie Wei Chong	1	The only restaurant I have been to which disallows drinking our own plain water. We would have ordered drinks if it wasn't super overpriced. Definitely a bad experience and would not recommend friends anymore	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
jorim tan	4	Post covid 19 I find that the menu has shrunk probably due to obvious reasons. However the pIzza is still good and have quite a crowd.	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
Alex Ng	4	Great pizza with very friendly staffs. Had the truffle oil pizza and it was really delicious.	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
Peter Lim	2	Bad service .  Very pricey. Food so so.  Loud speakers are just behind us. Asked to lower down the volume but was refused. Can't even combine tables to accommodate my family.  Reason given was stupid.  5 stars price and rules but 2 stars environment and service.	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
Destinee Oh	1	The food is satisfying but the service is really poor and disappointing. I have been celebrated mother's day here and is a very unhappy experience due to the poor service of the crew. It should be a very happy day as this is our family	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh
wkwsci 124	2	Used to be the best pizza spot but now is all just memories. Food is bad and oily and pricey not worth it	MichelangelO's Pizzeria	Ipoh

Andre Schoch	5	This popular Old Town cafÃ© is a bit cramped, but they offer quality food and very good coffees. The menu is Western-Asian fusion with some interesting dishes such as the 'spaghetti pork buddies', pasta with roasted pork and crackling (RM20) which was as tasty as it sounds	Aud's Cafe	Ipoh
William Ng	4	Converted from an old barber shop. Good service staff. Avo Joe (RM15 - avacado blended with espresso) is surprisingly good. They don't cancel each other out. Avo Regina (RM15 - avacado blended with milk) is a simpler drink. Mains weren't	Aud's Cafe	Ipoh
